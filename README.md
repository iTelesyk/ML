Hey hey Ivan - merry Christmas and happy holidays!!!

Also - when is the big day again? Or did the big day happen already???

If so - congrats on the baby girl!!! 

On the data science side: I've never actually had an official position as a data scientist, but I did a lot of ML / AI related stuff for Reliance, so I'd say I'm relatively well versed with the field. If you are looking for a job as a full time data scientist - from what I hear, they look for people that either have a programming background and some ML experience, or they tend to look for people that have a Masters or PhD in it. If you want to explore degrees, the below course I think is a good one and allows you to apply for an online masters program at University of Illinois:

On the programming side: Python and R are both the kings of ML. R is a bit hard to learn, but easy to use and extremely powerful. On the other hand, if I had to choose between the 2, I'd definitely go with Python. It's the most widely used language in the world, as well as the one with the lightest learning curve. Writing code in it is almost like writing english and understanding it is usually a breeze. The big thing with whichever language you choose is just sticking with it and getting some practice. I don't really have a lot of experience with courses / books for either one of these, but the link which you included does have some interesting Python material, so I think that the Keggle links could be very useful. On my side - I got a lot of practice by just using both languages on the job and figuring things as I went along. I also wrote a minor 'Learn R by Example' program and you can find it here in case you're interested: https://github.com/photonlines/Learn-R-by-Example

On the machine learning side: the best course and best intro that I found was the one by Microsoft, but I think that they archived it ( you can see the old link here: https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:Microsoft+DAT203x+3T2015/course/ ). If you already took the one by Andrew Ng and you were OK with the explanations there though - you should be good to go. Just as an FYI though - although a lot of people seem to like that course, I thought that it was pretty terrible introductory material. It didn't really get into a lot of applications and relied a lot on the mathematics and the theoretical aspects in explaining concepts without delving into the practical side. The fast AI course linked below I think is a lot better:

This thread also contains a lot of good info on learning material: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21924298

If you're interested in books, the ones below I think are the best ones (and I'll send you the e-books later):

Data Smart (this is a good intro level course that explains main concepts through Excel): https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17682206-data-smart

Data Science for Business (also really good intro level explanations): https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17912916-data-science-for-business
FYI - the book Elements of Statistical Learning is also good, but it's a lot more theoretical, and presents the topics for mathematicians - so it's up to you on which one you choose / prefer. If you like math, then the 2nd one is great as well. 

Machine Learning Engineering (this is a good overview of what you should know on the job - and quite a quick read): https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55275944-machine-learning-engineering
You can find the free book here: http://www.mlebook.com/wiki/doku.php

If you want to keep up with the 'latest and greatest,' these Youtube channels / github repositories do a good job of summarizing the theoretical and research side:

On the data analytics front: you're a smart guy, so I can assure you that you won't have any problem getting other jobs in that domain once you get some experience under your belt. If you have a good math background (which I know you do), and you have a good handle on Excel - those are the keystones.If you want to have a leg up over other applicants, I'd highly recommend for you to thoroughly learn SQL, since it'll give you superpowers when it comes to getting things done in that role. For SQL resources - I don't have anything on me at this moment, but I can send you more info and e-books if you want when I get back.

I'm actually not at home right now - I'm out of town and with my family, but if you ever want to talk, I'll be back later this week. My Skype username is nick.miljkovic and you can always just ping me on Whatsapp or give me a call (416-728-9254). I'll send you a link to the ebooks I mentioned above using Google drive when I get back.

Anyways - I'm sorry to hear about the Pratt and Whitney issues buddy. Right now, COVID is causing a disruption to almost every industry, but I know that aviation is the one that took the biggest hit. Travel worldwide is in the gutter now, but I have a good feeling that by mid-year next year, we'll be out of the woods so things will get better :)

All the best and I'll ping you again when I get back - I definitely want to catch up with you guys on Skype, so if you have an account, let's connect and catch up man!

Best,

Nick
